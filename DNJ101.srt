00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:09,639
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I’m Josh Nichols.

1
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,803
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I should probably be doing my homework.

1
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,708
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I’m just doing my homework here.

1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:14,585
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">But it’s more fun to do this. 

1
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:18,185
(playing guitar riff)

1
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,225
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Man, I’m thirsty.

1
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:24,402

00:00:24,402 --> 00:00:25,000
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Ah.

1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,435

1
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:27,000
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Ah.

1
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,682
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I live here with my mom and my little sister, Megan.

1
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:35,185
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I’ve got a great family, even though it’s just me and my dad. I love that guy.

1
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:36,381
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I love girls. 

1
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,981
So my moms been dating this guy.

1
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:44,464
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">So my dad’s been dating this woman. She’s really great.

Josh. | Drake.

1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,114
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">It’s not that I have anything against Josh.

1
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:56,485
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I really don’t know Drake all that well.

1
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:58,466
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">But he seems kind of …

1
00:00:58,466 --> 00:00:59,311
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Okay.

1
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,343
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">…unusual.

1
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:16,454
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Ugh.

1
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:29,590
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">What happened? I heard screaming!

1
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,783
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">It’s all right, son. There’s nothing to mop here.

1
00:01:32,783 --> 00:01:36,900
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Josh, w-what are you doing here? What’s he doing here?

1
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,577
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Tell him.

1
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:40,375
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Wait. Uh, Drake, quick, get your sister.

00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:46,290
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Oh, are they done sucking face yet?

1
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:54,637
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Kids, Josh’s Dad and I have been going out for a long time now, and we have some news.

1
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:58,593
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">You got me a dirt bike?

1
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:02,185
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">No.

1
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:04,738
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">We’re getting married.

1
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:18,589
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Wait, wait. You mean he’s going to be my-my stepfather?

?I fond a way, I found a way

1
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:52,032
?If you open up your mind, to see what’s inside

1
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:59,032
?It’s gonna take some time to realize 

1
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:06,032
?but if you look inside, I’m sure you’ll find

1
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:16,032
?over your shoulder you know that I told you I’ll always be picking you up when you’re down

1
00:03:16,032 --> 00:03:23,532
?So just turn around?

1
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:26,032
Ooh- ooh-ooh- ooh?

1
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:33,076
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Drake? Josh is downstairs.

1
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:38,503
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Oh, really? ‘cause I was just writing a song about him. It’s called, “I’m not sharing my room with Josh”

1
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:45,446
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Look, I know this is going to be a big adjustment. But I need you to give this a chance.

1
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:48,320
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">But Mom, he’s goofy. He’s clammy.

<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Hiya, Drake.

1
00:03:49,283 --> 00:03:50,695
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">He’s here.

1
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:57,103
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I brought you some licorice, the red kind. I know some people like he black kind, but I thought I’d play it safe and…

1
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:01,919
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Mom, don’t do this to me.

1
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,316
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I should have got the black kind, right?

1
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,806
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Have a good time, boys.

1
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:12,755
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Wow, cool room. Ah, and check out the bed!

1
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:28,942
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">There! I sleep there. You sleep on the couch.

1
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:33,582
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">The couch? Yeah, I don’t know. I have lumber problems.

1
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:43,062
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">And how much junk did you bring? Eww, who reads the school newspaper?

1
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,077
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I do. It’s good.

1
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:51,498
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">It’s stupid. Ooh, look, a poem by Janitor Jones. “The toilet, Don’t Soil It.”

1
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,025
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">That’s clever.

1
00:04:55,025 --> 00:05:00,780
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Right. Oh, and here’s the worst. Miss Nancy’s advice column. What a load.

1
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,183
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">A load of good. I think Miss Nancy gives great advice.

1
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:08,415
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Whatever, man. I’m going to go play some hoops.

1
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:10,744
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Uh, Drake, when will you be back?

1
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,937
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I don’t know. A few hours?

1
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:18,209
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Good. I mean, have fun with the hoops and whatnot.

1
00:05:22,586 --> 00:05:24,950
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Now it’s my turn to kiss you.

1
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,685
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Now it’s my turn to kiss you.

1
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:34,654
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Now it’s my turn to throw up.

1
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:38,446
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Don’t you have something to do?

1
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:40,067
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Yeah, I’m going to go play some ball.

1
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,232
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Did you ask your brother if he wants to play?

1
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:46,049
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">You know, mom, I don’t really think Josh is the basketball type.

1
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:50,159
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Sure he is. Yeah, I taught him myself. Here, toss me the rock. 

1
00:05:59,159 --> 00:05:59,852
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Think fast.

1
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:07,260
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Lamps don’t think that fast.

1
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,073
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Just go ask Josh to play.

1
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:18,062
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Hey, Josh, you don’t want to go play any basket… ball!

1
00:06:18,062 --> 00:06:19,821
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">(screaming)

1
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:21,701
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Oh, my god!

1
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:22,414
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I can explain!

1
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:23,127
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Oh, my god!

1
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:24,927
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I can explain!

1
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:28,381
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Mom! Josh is dressed like a freak!

1
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:30,283
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I can explain!

1
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:36,578
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Why are you dressed like queen Latifah?

1
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:41,966
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Because I… I… oh, I can’t tell you.

1
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:43,674
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Mom, Josh is dressed like… !

1
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:47,440
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Shh! All right! I’ll tell you, but you’ve got to swear to keep it a secret.

1
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,300
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Fine, I swear. Now talk.

1
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:57,300
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">All right. I’m, uh… I’m… Miss… 

1
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,574
(mumbles)

1
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:02,939
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">What?

1
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:08,113
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I’m Miss Nancy, okay? I am Miss Nancy.

1
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:14,796
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Wait. From the advice column? Fr…from the school newspaper? You’re Miss Nancy?

1
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:15,526
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Yes.

1
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:20,617
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">(laughing)

1
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:25,416
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Quit laughing. Being Miss Nancy is very important to me. I help people with their problems.

1
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,757
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">You can’t help people by wearing pants?

1
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:35,484
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">You don’t understand. I need the dress. I…I can’t write good advice unless I’m wearing it.

1
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:39,908
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">You want some good advice? Stop dressing like a lady.

1
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:46,000
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">If dressing like a lady helps me help others, then dress like a lady I shall.

1
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:51,024
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">“Dear Miss Nancy…”

1
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:52,807
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Hey, give me that.

1
00:07:52,807 --> 00:08:01,294
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">“My boyfriend doesn’t understand me. He’s never romantic. I wish he would just bring me flowers or write me poems or cook me romantic dinners. ”

1
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,396
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">That’s for Miss Nancy only.

1
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:08,096
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Wait a second. Purple ink? Dots her i’s with little hearts? 

1
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:12,961
This letter is from Tiffany Margolas. (inhales deeply)

1
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:17,512
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Quit sniffing my mail!

1
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:21,512
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Dude, Tiffany Margolas is, like, the hottest girl in school.

1
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:27,926
Hey… she’s not happy with her boyfriend.

1
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:32,307
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">What are you thinking? What are you thinking?!

1
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:41,595
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Poor Tiffany. So sad… so lonely… so hot. Yeah, I think I can’t help her.

1
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:47,345
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">No. No, I’m not going to let you use my letters for your own selfish desires.

1
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:53,861
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Fine. Then I’ll just tell the whole world that my new stepbrother, Josh Nichols, is the real, live, Miss Nancy.

1
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:56,446
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">You’re not that evil.

1
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:02,437
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">People of the world, listen up! Josh Nichols is Miss…

1
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:06,000
(grunts) Ahhh! My spine! My spine!

1
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:11,141
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">You can’t tell people I’m Miss Nancy. You’ll ruin everything.

1
00:09:11,141 --> 00:09:15,371
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Fine, then don’t stop me from helping Tiffany. Deal?

1
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:16,377
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">All right.

<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">You bet.

1
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,900
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Good. Here comes Buck.

1
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,943
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I hope you have an ambulance standing by.

1
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:27,628
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Yeah, I do. For you.

1
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:31,417
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">(crowd hooting)

1
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:33,096
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Talk’s cheap. (or Quadlers)

1
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:35,636
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">40 Quatloos on the newcomer.

1
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:37,707
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Remember the plan.

1
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:46,113
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Right. I jab, o punch and stay away from him until he gets tired. And then he’s my little girl. (karate yell)

1
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:46,887
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Do it.

1
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:49,750
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">You ready?

1
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,176
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Oh, yeah, baby. Come on, let’s do this. Let’s go…

1
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:02,698
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Come on, Tiff. Let’s go get some sorbet.

1
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:04,649
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Oh, Buck.

1
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:20,778
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Where is it?! Where’d you put it?!

1
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:22,736
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I thought you weren’t ever talking to me again.

1
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:27,013
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I have to write my Miss Nancy column. Now where is my dress?

1
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:30,987
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I hid it.

1
00:21:30,987 --> 00:21:34,896
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">That’s it. You are the worst stepbrother ever.

1
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:37,338
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Ooh. Harsh. I’m going to go make myself a sandwich.

1
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:45,454
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">You give me my dress. Or I will unleash $30 worth of karate on you.

1
00:21:46,454 --> 00:21:47,773
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">No.

1
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,367
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Man!

1
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:53,769
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Look, I’m trying to do something nice for you. You said yourself, you hated dressing up like a woman.

1
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:54,309
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">So?

1
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:56,879
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">So you don’t need the dress to give good advice.

1
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:58,517
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I told you, I do.

1
00:21:58,517 --> 00:21:59,615
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">You don’t.

1
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:00,817
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Give me my dress!

1
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:01,360
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">No.

1
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,041
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Give it!

1
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:02,387
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">No.

1
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:02,988
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Drake

1
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:08,105
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Question. If somebody told you that they had to wear a dress to give good advice, what would you say?

1
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:08,631
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I don’t know.

1
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:09,381
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">What would you say?

1
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:10,119
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Drake, I…

1
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:11,082
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">What would you say?

1
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:18,624
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I’d say that’s ridiculous! I’d say good advice comes from the heart and from what’s inside you, not the clothes you wear.

1
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,566
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">That’s stupid.

1
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:20,931
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">It’s not stupid.

1
00:22:20,931 --> 00:22:22,615
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Yeah, it is. That’s stupid advice.

1
00:22:22,615 --> 00:22:24,219
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">It’s good advice.

1
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,346
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I’m sorry, what’s you say?

1
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:27,030
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I said it’s good advice.

1
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:34,908
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Well, guess what, Josh? Look like you just gave some good advice. And I don’t see you wearing any dress.

1
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:44,824
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Holy… You’re right.

1
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:46,968
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I know.

1
00:22:46,968 --> 00:22:52,275
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I gave good advice while wearing pants.

1
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:54,640
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Praise be the pants.

1
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,493
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I never have to dress like a freakish man-lady again. 

1
00:22:59:640 --> 00:23:04,493
Ah, Drake! Sorry! I forgot you’re not comfortable with the hugging.

1
00:23:04,493 --> 00:23:15,022
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Thanks. Look, man, I… I’m sorry I got you into this whole thing with Buck and the black eye and…

1
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:19,819
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">It’s okay. I know you didn’t mean to.

1
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:33,919
And listen, um… Sorry that I said you were a bad stepbrother. I didn’t mean that. We sill friends?

1
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:40,912
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Friends? No way, man. We’re brothers.

1
00:23:43,912 --> 00:23:47,046
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">May I ?

1
00:23:47,046 --> 00:23:49,816
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Hug me, brother.

1
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:57,544
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">I can’t believe you went on a date with a wimp like that.

1
00:23:57,544 --> 00:24:02,002
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Oh, I wasn’t on a date with him. I was on a date with him.

1
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:06,465
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Oh, Buck. Buck, Buck, it was nothing. It was…it was…

1
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:09,553
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">(bell rings)

1
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:18,204
<font face="Arial" color="white" size="18">Is he tired yet?

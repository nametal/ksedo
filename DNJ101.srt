1
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:08,198
My name’s Drake Parker.

1
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:09,639
I’m Josh Nichols.

1
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,803
I should probably be doing my homework.

1
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,708
I’m just doing my homework here.

1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:14,585
But it’s more fun to do this. 

1
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:18,185
(playing guitar riff)

1
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,225
Man, I’m thirsty.

1
00:00:24,402 --> 00:00:25,000
Ah.

1
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:27,000
Ah.

1
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,682
I live here with my mom and my little sister, Megan.

1
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:35,185
I’ve got a great family, even though it’s just me and my dad. I love that guy.

1
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:36,381
I love girls. 

1
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,981
So my moms been dating this guy.

1
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:44,464
So my dad’s been dating this woman. She’s really great.

1
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:48,038
He’s okay, but he’s got this kid that goes to my school.

1
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:50,000
She has a son that goes to my school. 

1
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,800
[Drake] Josh
[Josh] Drake

1
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,114
It’s not that I have anything against Josh.

1
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:56,485
I really don’t know Drake all that well.

1
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:58,466
But he seems kind of …

1
00:00:58,466 --> 00:00:59,311
Okay.

1
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,343
…unusual.

1
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:13,884
(quiet moaning)

1
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:16,454
Ugh.

1
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:20,000
(moaning continues)

1
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,087
(blows whistle loudly)

1
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:24,077
Drake!

1
00:01:24,077 --> 00:01:27,205
Hey, Mom. Mr. Nichols.

1
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:29,590
What happened? I heard screaming!

1
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,783
It’s all right, son. There’s nothing to mop here.

1
00:01:32,783 --> 00:01:36,900
Josh, w-what are you doing here? What’s he doing here?

1
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,577
Tell him.

1
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:40,375
Wait. Uh, Drake, quick, get your sister.

1
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,559
Megan!

1
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:46,290
Oh, are they done sucking face yet?

1
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:54,637
Kids, Josh’s Dad and I have been going out for a long time now, and we have some news.

1
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:58,593
You got me a dirt bike?

1
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:02,185
No.

1
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:04,738
We’re getting married.

1
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:10,041
Oh… uh…you’re getting mmm… ma…

1
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,109
Yeah. We’re going to be one big old happy family.

1
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:18,589
Wait, wait. You mean he’s going to be my-my stepfather?

1
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:21,128
(chuckling)

1
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:29,554
And you! You’re going to be my… he’s going to be my…

1
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:31,512
Hug me, brother!

1
00:02:32,512 --> 00:02:36,080

Drake? Josh is downstairs.

1
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:38,503
Oh, really? ‘cause I was just writing a song about him. It’s called, “I’m not sharing my room with Josh”

1
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:45,446
Look, I know this is going to be a big adjustment. But I need you to give this a chance.

1
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:48,320
But Mom, he’s goofy. He’s clammy.

1
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,283
Hiya, Drake.

1
00:03:49,283 --> 00:03:50,695
He’s here.

1
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:57,103
I brought you some licorice, the red kind. I know some people like he black kind, but I thought I’d play it safe and…

1
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:01,919
Mom, don’t do this to me.

1
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,316
I should have got the black kind, right?

1
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,806
Have a good time, boys.

1
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:12,755
Wow, cool room. Ah, and check out the bed!

1
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:15,625
Wait,wait, no, no, no, no, no, No. no no… oh!

1
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:24,726
Dude, these sheets match my jimmies. So where you gonna sleep?

1
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:28,942
There! I sleep there. You sleep on the couch.

1
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:33,582
The couch? Yeah, I don’t know. I have lumber problems.

1
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:43,062
And how much junk did you bring? Eww, who reads the school newspaper?

1
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,077
I do. It’s good.

1
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:51,498
It’s stupid. Ooh, look, a poem by Janitor Jones. “The toilet, Don’t Soil It.”

1
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,025
That’s clever.

1
00:04:55,025 --> 00:05:00,780
Right. Oh, and here’s the worst. Miss Nancy’s advice column. What a load.

1
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,183
A load of good. I think Miss Nancy gives great advice.

1
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:08,415
Whatever, man. I’m going to go play some hoops.

1
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:10,744
Uh, Drake, when will you be back?

1
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,937
I don’t know. A few hours?

1
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:18,209
Good. I mean, have fun with the hoops and whatnot.

1
00:05:22,586 --> 00:05:24,950
Now it’s my turn to kiss you.

1
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,685
Now it’s my turn to kiss you.

1
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:34,654
Now it’s my turn to throw up.

1
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:38,446
Don’t you have something to do?

1
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:40,067
Yeah, I’m going to go play some ball.

1
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,232
Did you ask your brother if he wants to play?

1
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:46,049
You know, mom, I don’t really think Josh is the basketball type.

1
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:50,159
Sure he is. Yeah, I taught him myself. Here, toss me the rock. 

1
00:05:59,159 --> 00:05:59,852
Think fast.

1
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:07,260
Lamps don’t think that fast.

1
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,073
Just go ask Josh to play.

1
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:18,062
Hey, Josh, you don’t want to go play any basket… ball!

1
00:06:18,062 --> 00:06:19,821
(screaming)

1
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:21,701
Oh, my god!

1
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:22,414
I can explain!

1
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:23,127
Oh, my god!

1
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:24,927
I can explain!

1
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:28,381
Mom! Josh is dressed like a freak!

1
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:30,283
I can explain!

1
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:36,578
Why are you dressed like queen Latifah?

1
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:41,966
Because I… I… oh, I can’t tell you.

1
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:43,674
Mom, Josh is dressed like… !

1
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:47,440
Shh! All right! I’ll tell you, but you’ve got to swear to keep it a secret.

1
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,300
Fine, I swear. Now talk.

1
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:57,300
All right. I’m, uh… I’m… Miss… 

1
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,574
(mumbles)

1
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:02,939
What?

1
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:08,113
I’m Miss Nancy, okay? I am Miss Nancy.

1
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:14,796
Wait. From the advice column? Fr…from the school newspaper? You’re Miss Nancy?

1
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:15,526
Yes.

1
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:20,617
(laughing)

1
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:25,416
Quit laughing. Being Miss Nancy is very important to me. I help people with their problems.

1
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,757
You can’t help people by wearing pants?

1
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:35,484
You don’t understand. I need the dress. I…I can’t write good advice unless I’m wearing it.

1
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:39,908
You want some good advice? Stop dressing like a lady.

1
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:46,000
If dressing like a lady helps me help others, then dress like a lady I shall.

1
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:51,024
“Dear Miss Nancy…”

1
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:52,807
Hey, give me that.

1
00:07:52,807 --> 00:08:01,294
“My boyfriend doesn’t understand me. He’s never romantic. I wish he would just bring me flowers or write me poems or cook me romantic dinners. ”

1
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,396
That’s for Miss Nancy only.

1
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:08,096
Wait a second. Purple ink? Dots her i’s with little hearts? 

1
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:12,961
This letter is from Tiffany Margolas. (inhales deeply)

1
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:17,512
Quit sniffing my mail!

1
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:21,512
Dude, Tiffany Margolas is, like, the hottest girl in school.

1
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:27,926
Hey… she’s not happy with her boyfriend.

1
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:32,307
What are you thinking? What are you thinking?!

1
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:41,595
Poor Tiffany. So sad… so lonely… so hot. Yeah, I think I can’t help her.

1
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:47,345
No. No, I’m not going to let you use my letters for your own selfish desires.

1
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:53,861
Fine. Then I’ll just tell the whole world that my new stepbrother, Josh Nichols, is the real, live, Miss Nancy.

1
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:56,446
You’re not that evil.

1
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:02,437
People of the world, listen up! Josh Nichols is Miss…

1
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:06,000
(grunts) Ahhh! My spine! My spine!

1
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:11,141
You can’t tell people I’m Miss Nancy. You’ll ruin everything.

1
00:09:11,141 --> 00:09:15,371
Fine, then don’t stop me from helping Tiffany. Deal?

1
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:16,377
All right.

1
00:09:16,377 --> 00:09:17,371
all right?

1
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:20,444
All right.

1
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:21,328
Are those real?

1
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,473
Stop that.

1
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,540
(bell rings)

1
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:42,617
Beauty, beauty… rhymes with snooty? Um… fruity. No . Beauty, beauty.

1
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:43,878
What are you writing?

1
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:48,294
Oh, nothing. Just a… poem.

1
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:50,287
You write poetry?

1
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:52,223
I know it’s dumb.

1
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:58,552
No, no, I don’t… I don’t think it’s dumb at all. Is this for a class?

1
00:09:58,552 --> 00:10:00,537
No, it’s for a person.

1
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:01,816
Oh.

1
00:10:01,816 --> 00:10:07,748
Well, it would be for a person if I had a person for it to be for.

1
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:09,537
Oh…

1
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:14,746
Yeah, well, I should go. I’ve got to go download a recipe off the internet.

1
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:17,369
A recipe? You cook?

1
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:19,952
When I’m not picking flowers. Listen, uh…

1
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,765
Tiffany.

1
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:23,718
Drake. I don’t know if you’re doing anything Friday night…

1
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:24,575
I’m not.

1
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:27,878
Really? Uh, maybe I could cook you some dinner

1
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,252
That would be… nice.

1
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:31,752
So it’s a date?

1
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:34,178 
So, it is.

1
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:35,000
Cool.

1
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,510
(bell rings)

1
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,000
See ya.

1
00:10:40,492 --> 00:10:43,355
That was too easy.

1
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:47,338
Evil! Evil!

1
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:56,108
Drake, Josh, your dinner’s on the table.

1
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:56,821
Okay.

1
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:57,868
Thanks.

1
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:19,966
No way.

1
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:24,106
Look, what’s the whole reason you do your Miss Nancy advice column, huh?

1
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:28,223
To help people with their problems, and/or issues.

1
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:36,792
So, if buy Tiffany some flowers, write he a couple poems and cook her a nice, romantic dinner, that will solve her problem, won’t it?

1
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:41,314
Wait. You know how to cook?

1
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:44,036
Nope. But I hear you do.

1
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,721
No! No. No, sir, I’m not cooking dinner for Tiffany.

1
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:50,599
I know who Miss Nancy is! I know who Miss Nancy is!

1
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:54,751
Okay, all right! I’ll cook the dinner. Aw, you hand licker.

1
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:57,883
Come on, let’s eat.

1
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,563
(both screaming)

1
00:12:18,014 --> 00:12:21,207
(both screaming)

1
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:25,319
That’s mine, that’s mine!

1
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:37,248
(glass breaks)

1
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:42,251
The hose!

1
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:43,422
What hose?!

1
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:44,089
The hose!

1
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:45,276
What hose?!

1
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:46,201
The window!

1
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:52,365
Ow, ow.

1
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:21,303
Drake, this ravioli is amazing. What’s it called?

1
00:13:21,303 --> 00:13:29,453
Oh, well, you know… it’s… it’s ravioli from a… (mumbles)

1
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:30,761
I never heard of it.

1
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:32,290
Neither have I.

1
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,556
Who’s that?

1
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:36,298
Josh!

1
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:38,177
Hi. Hi.

1
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:41,194
I know you. You go to our school, right?

1
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:43,729
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

1
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:50,159
Uh, actually we’re stepbrothers, and Josh isn’t supposed to be here right now.

1
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,868
I can’t stay in the kitchen forever.

1
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:53,896
Why not?

1
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:56,506
I have to use the little boy’s room.

1
00:13:56,506 --> 00:13:58,711
There’s a sink in the kitchen.

1
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:03,968
Josh, did you try some of this ravioli that Drake made? It’s incredible.

1
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:13,108
Oh, is it? Now tell me, Drake, how do you make it?

1
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,655
You know, it’s really time for dessert. Tiffany, I’ll take your plate.

1
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:23,476
You know, your stepbrother is really something.

1
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,576
Yeah, he’s something.

1
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:31,002
I mean, he’s so sensitive, you know? The flowers, the poetry, this awesome dinner. 

1
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:33,292
I mean my boyfriend never does any f this stuff.

1
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:37,860
I know. I mean, I know what you mean.

1
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,223
(knocking)

1
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:40,734
Who’s that?

1
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:41,813
I don’t know.

1
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:43,217
(banging on door)

1
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,999
All right, all right, I’m coming.

1
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:50,033
Buck!

1
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:53,701
So, it’s true.

1
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:56,132
What? That I have a concussion?

1
00:14:57,132 --> 00:15:02,887
I turn my back for five minutes and you’re out on a date with…with this clown?

1
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:06,655
Trouble… breathing.

1
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,664
I can date whoever I want.

1
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:11,641
Yeah? Well, you can’t date a guy with no head.

1
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:12,684
(whimpering)

1
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:16,572
You’re hamburger meat. You understand me?

1
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:19,738
But I’m a vegetarian.

1
00:15:19,738 --> 00:15:26,172
Monday, 3:00, you and me. Have an ambulance ready.

1
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:34,142
That was so romantic.

1
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:38,422
And dessert is here. Josh, u thought you had to pee.

1
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:41,052
Done.

1
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:57,159
How could you get me into a fight with Buck?

1
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,624
Oh, this is my fault?

1
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,719
Oh, let me think. Yes. 

1
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:05,519
You realize he’s going to destroy me.

1
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,503
He’s not going to destroy you.

1
00:16:07,503 --> 00:16:10,800
He’s huge, and stupid. 

1
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:15,271
That’s a bad combination.

1
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:21,570
You’re right he’s going to kill you. Hey, can I have your computer?

1
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:30,836
Oh. I can’t fight Buck. He’ll hurt me in so many ways. What am I going to do?

1
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:32,323
I got it.

1
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:41,336
(karate yells) 

1
00:16:41,336 --> 00:16:44,259
(speaking Japanese)

1
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:45,373
Uh, hey, dude.

1
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:49,373
(yells)

1
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:54,120
Take a break. How can I help you?

1
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,436
I need you to make me an expert in karate by tomorrow.

1
00:16:57,436 --> 00:17:06,804
(cackling) Gentlemen! To learn karate, it takes years of intense training.

1
00:17:06,804 --> 00:17:09,452
yeah, but can’t you just give him the one day crash course?

1
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:14,600
No. Karate is in here. Not in here. 

1
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,800
Sometimes in here. One time in here. But that was after I swallowed a box of thumbtacks. 

1
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,400
What? Do I have something in my teeth?

1
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,892
No. Look, I’ve got 48 hours. You going to teach me karate or not?

1
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:43,936
I am sorry, boys. I can do nothing for you in so little time.

1
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:46,231
We’ll give you 30 bucks cash.

1
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,592
Let the training begin. (yells)

1
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:51,116
Ahhh.

1
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:27,508
Yeah, what’s up? Who’s the little girl now? I did it. Thanks, Drake.

1
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:29,918
I’m not comfortable with the hugging.

1
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,244
Sorry.

1
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:32,548
So you think he’s ready?

1
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,006
As ready as 30 bucks will get him.

1
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:36,275
All right.

1
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:42,281
So, you boys like chicken tenders?

1
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:52,017
(bell rings)

1
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:56,884
How you feel?

1
00:19:56,884 --> 00:20:00,122
Good, strong. (karate yell)

1
00:20:00,122 --> 00:20:05,549
Don’t get overconfident. This guy is big, tough and stupid. So remember the plan.

1
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:08,452
Right. Go over it again?

1
00:20:08,452 --> 00:20:14,117
You jab, you kick, and you stay away from him. Make him keep coming after you. eventually he’ll get tired and then you’ll…

1
00:20:14,117 --> 00:20:15,146
(karate yell)

1
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:16,909
That’s my boy. You ready?

1
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:17,759
You bet.

1
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,900
Good. Here comes Buck.

1
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,943
I hope you have an ambulance standing by.

1
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:27,628
Yeah, I do. For you.

1
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:31,417
(crowd hooting)

1
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:33,096
Talk’s cheap. (or Quadlers)

1
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:35,636
40 Quatloos on the newcomer.

1
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:37,707
Remember the plan.

1
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:46,113
Right. I jab, o punch and stay away from him until he gets tired. And then he’s my little girl. (karate yell)

1
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:46,887
Do it.

1
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:49,750
You ready?

1
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,176
Oh, yeah, baby. Come on, let’s do this. Let’s go…

1
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:02,698
Come on, Tiff. Let’s go get some sorbet.

1
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:04,649
Oh, Buck.

1
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:20,778
Where is it?! Where’d you put it?!

1
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:22,736
I thought you weren’t ever talking to me again.

1
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:27,013
I have to write my Miss Nancy column. Now where is my dress?

1
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:30,987
I hid it.

1
00:21:30,987 --> 00:21:34,896
That’s it. You are the worst stepbrother ever.

1
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:37,338
Ooh. Harsh. I’m going to go make myself a sandwich.

1
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:45,454
You give me my dress. Or I will unleash $30 worth of karate on you.

1
00:21:46,454 --> 00:21:47,773
No.

1
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,367
Man!

1
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:53,769
Look, I’m trying to do something nice for you. You said yourself, you hated dressing up like a woman.

1
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:54,309
So?

1
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:56,879
So you don’t need the dress to give good advice.

1
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:58,517
I told you, I do.

1
00:21:58,517 --> 00:21:59,615
You don’t.

1
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:00,817
Give me my dress!

1
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:01,360
No.

1
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,041
Give it!

1
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:02,387
No.

1
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:02,988
Drake

1
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:08,105
Question. If somebody told you that they had to wear a dress to give good advice, what would you say?

1
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:08,631
I don’t know.

1
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:09,381
What would you say?

1
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:10,119
Drake, I…

1
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:11,082
What would you say?

1
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:18,624
I’d say that’s ridiculous! I’d say good advice comes from the heart and from what’s inside you, not the clothes you wear.

1
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,566
That’s stupid.

1
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:20,931
It’s not stupid.

1
00:22:20,931 --> 00:22:22,615
Yeah, it is. That’s stupid advice.

1
00:22:22,615 --> 00:22:24,219
It’s good advice.

1
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,346
I’m sorry, what’s you say?

1
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:27,030
I said it’s good advice.

1
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:34,908
Well, guess what, Josh? Look like you just gave some good advice. And I don’t see you wearing any dress.

1
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:44,824
Holy… You’re right.

1
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:46,968
I know.

1
00:22:46,968 --> 00:22:52,275
I gave good advice while wearing pants.

1
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:54,640
Praise be the pants.

1
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,493
I never have to dress like a freakish man-lady again. 

1
00:22:59:640 --> 00:23:04,493
Ah, Drake! Sorry! I forgot you’re not comfortable with the hugging.

1
00:23:04,493 --> 00:23:15,022
Thanks. Look, man, I… I’m sorry I got you into this whole thing with Buck and the black eye and…

1
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:19,819
It’s okay. I know you didn’t mean to.

1
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:33,919
And listen, um… Sorry that I said you were a bad stepbrother. I didn’t mean that. We sill friends?

1
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:40,912
Friends? No way, man. We’re brothers.

1
00:23:43,912 --> 00:23:47,046
May I ?

1
00:23:47,046 --> 00:23:49,816
Hug me, brother.

1
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:57,544
I can’t believe you went on a date with a wimp like that.

1
00:23:57,544 --> 00:24:02,002
Oh, I wasn’t on a date with him. I was on a date with him.

1
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:06,465
Oh, Buck. Buck, Buck, it was nothing. It was…it was…

1
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:09,553
(bell rings)

1
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:18,204
Is he tired yet?
